<p>![](/images/slum-area/149_0.jpg)</p><p><font size="1">↑Tony(Left) and Leo's(Right) chance encounter in Chiayi Train Station</font> </p><p>     It's a short story......</p><p>     It occured right on the next day I came bake to Chiyi from Pingtung. On that day I had to keep an appointment with Little Dish(Nick name) in Chiayi M<span class="a">cdonalds at noon for taking back my books I had once lent her. And after this, I had to rush back to Shueishang to one of my friends' home for returning some books I had once borrowed him. It could have been easily done, but an incident delayed me while I was going to buy ticket to Shueishang......</span></p><p><span class="a">     I saw a group of foreigners near by the bus terminal with anxiety, talking to an attendant in English while that attendant could not understand English. I thought they were comparing apples to oranges. As I am a meddlesome guy,</span><span class="a"> I just hurried forward and cut in on their conversation. Well, it became my first experience to do instant translation, between English and Taiwanese.</span></p><p><span class="a">      After a peried of communication, I came to be known that those foreigners lost one of their luggages on the bus they took from Mt. Ali to Chiayi City, so I told the attendant to find out the final bus stop of that line, and call the driver to remind him to unload the luggage and leave it at that bus stop.</span></p><p><span class="a">     Then I brought Leo(One of the foreigners, I guess he might be the leader.) to that bus stop, taking his luggage, and then brought him back to Chiayi Train Station.</span></p><p><span class="a">     Leo is a good guy, as well as an engineer who works in HP Personal Systems Group, and he usually journey to and fro between Taiwan and USA. During his traveling in Chiayi we acquainted with each other and exchange our Emails just on account of his luggage losing and a chance encouter with me. Up to now, we are still keep in touch~</span></p><p><span class="a">     It's fate, isn't it?  </span></p><p><span class="a"></span></p><p><span class="a">PS. </span></p><p><span class="a">if anyone is interested in Leo's Taiwan experiences, just click the address below, and you will find his blog. </span></p><p><span class="a"><a href="http://www.gertens4.blogspot.com">www.gertens4.blogspot.com</a></span></p>
