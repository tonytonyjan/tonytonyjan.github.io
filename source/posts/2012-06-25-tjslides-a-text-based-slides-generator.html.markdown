Last week, I just realized one of my ideas, named [TJSlides].

TJSlides is a text based slides generator using [Markdown] syntax. What you need is a text area, and you can easily make a presentation. I think it's cool, isn't it?

I had this sudden interesting inspiration last week, then I tried to google this idea and found someone has made this named [Hekyll], however, I don't think it's convenient enough on account of it's dependency on [Jekyll]. I need to run command by hand to generate slides, that's too troublesome.

I have no idea how it worth. I just made it when I still think it's interesting. =D

Enjoy!
