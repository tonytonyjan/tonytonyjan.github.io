<p>話說雜碎錄不會推歌的，這樣擺上來真的很奇怪XD</p><p>但今天去Grammy.com挖寶，被我找到這一首歌，很喜歡她的歌詞，突然就想放上來，說實話，能出現在Grammy上的歌，不管獲獎或只是入圍，全都不簡單啊！</p><p><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ArAlk3yf5hI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>有時候我們會反覆去聽一首歌</em></p><p><em>但那也許不是因為旋律，也不是因為歌手</em></p><p><em>而是這首歌</em></p><p><em>正說著我們的故事&hellip;&hellip;</em></p><hr /><p>Jewel - Satisfied</p><p>If you love somebody<br />You better let it out<br />Don't hold it back<br />While you're trying to figure it out<br />Don't be timid<br />Don't be afraid to hurt<br />Run toward the flame<br />Run toward the fire<br />Hold on for all your worth<br />Cause the only real pain a heart can ever know<br />Is the sorrow of regret<br />When you don't let your feelings show<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />So did you say it<br />Did you mean it<br />Did you lay it on the line<br />Did you make it count<br />Did you look 'em in the eye<br />Did they feel it<br />Did you say it in time<br />Did you say it out loud<br />'cause if you did hun<br />Then you lived some<br />That feeling inside<br />That's called satisfied<br /><br />Busy people walking by<br />Can't help but worry some<br />With so many things to do<br />So little love gets done<br />Empty hearts everywhere<br />Drowning but dying of thirst<br />If you want love<br />It's not that tough<br />Start by giving it first<br />It's so easy to give<br />Baby can't you see<br />Just close your eyes open your heart<br />And do what comes naturally<br /><br />[Repeat&nbsp;Chorus]</p><p>[Bridge]<br />Horses are built to run<br />The sun is meant to shine above<br />Flowers are made to bloom<br />And then there's us<br />We were born to love<br /><br />[Repeat Chorus]</p>
