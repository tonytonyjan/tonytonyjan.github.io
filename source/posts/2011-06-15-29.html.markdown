話說雜碎錄不會推歌的，這樣擺上來真的很奇怪XD



但今天去Grammy.com挖寶，被我找到這一首歌，很喜歡她的歌詞，突然就想放上來，說實話，能出現在Grammy上的歌，不管獲獎或只是入圍，全都不簡單啊！

*有時候我們會反覆去聽一首歌*



*但那也許不是因為旋律，也不是因為歌手*



*而是這首歌*



*正說著我們的故事&hellip;&hellip;*

Jewel - Satisfied



If you love somebody

You better let it out

Don't hold it back

While you're trying to figure it out

Don't be timid

Don't be afraid to hurt

Run toward the flame

Run toward the fire

Hold on for all your worth

Cause the only real pain a heart can ever know

Is the sorrow of regret

When you don't let your feelings show



[Chorus]

So did you say it

Did you mean it

Did you lay it on the line

Did you make it count

Did you look 'em in the eye

Did they feel it

Did you say it in time

Did you say it out loud

'cause if you did hun

Then you lived some

That feeling inside

That's called satisfied



Busy people walking by

Can't help but worry some

With so many things to do

So little love gets done

Empty hearts everywhere

Drowning but dying of thirst

If you want love

It's not that tough

Start by giving it first

It's so easy to give

Baby can't you see

Just close your eyes open your heart

And do what comes naturally



[Repeat&nbsp;Chorus]



[Bridge]

Horses are built to run

The sun is meant to shine above

Flowers are made to bloom

And then there's us

We were born to love



[Repeat Chorus]
