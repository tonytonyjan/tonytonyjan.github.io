[TJMarkdownPaste][site] is a Markdown bloggin service with Tex mathematical syntax and automatic code highlight.

It aims to build a blogging service that belongs to we engineers and mathematician. It's a leisure project after my work, so there is no explicit schedule or plan. Feel free to [join us][project site] if your are interested in our project, then we can work together and discuss about the future of TJMarkdownPaste in the future together. =)
