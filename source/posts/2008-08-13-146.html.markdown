<p>Dear Yi Cih:</p><p>Well...As a matter of fact, I didn't know I had caused some annoyance to your best friend Cian Zih. I admit that I have dialed her deep in the night since few weeks ago. I am  really sorry, maybe I indeed did something imappropiate. I hope you can give me a chance to clarify my stand on this matter. Acctually, in that period I was in Pingtung as a volunteer teacher, and there is almost nothing for entertainment but my cell phone......Every night before I went to bed, I was used to 閒聊 with my family and friends, and she was just included. If it is this matter that made you feel &quot;not well,&quot; I am sorry. </p><p>However, I don't think the problem is such simple and just resulted of only a phone call at about 11o'clock. If you really have something else that you want to &quot;warn&quot; me, please, just shoot! What are you worried about? I am neither a bad guy nor an arsehole. Everything thing can be solved if you are willing to have some communication with me. I don't want to push you but......I just believe that there is nothing can't be settled with communicative competence. </p><p>So, what do you say? </p><p>Can we have a talk, Cai, Yi Cih?</p>
