<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Recently I met a girl from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>, named Annie Rose, and myacquaintance with her could be certainly said </span><span lang="EN-US">extraordinary.<o:p /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I built a blog of Yahoo 360 about half a year ago, and it had beenabandoned by me for a long long time, for that I had had a blog of Xuite and Iwas too lazy to handle both of them. So, the one of Yahoo 360 has become rusted.Still, there are few guests visiting, and they are mostly passerby, however,somehow, maybe being curious, Annie rang me few weeks ago. It’s the beginning ofour acquaintance.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">She is as old as I am, namely, she is a student now in a high school.Besides, she likes playing the piano, even composing music, just like me,nevertheless, she haven’t found a way to record her works. It’s a pity, isn’tit? Though I really want to listen to her masterpieces, what I can do now is waitand look for word. I think that will be very great to share our experience aboutcomposing the music and playing the piano.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In addition, she is now learning Chinese as a beginner, so she onlycan speak some easy words like ni hao, xie xie or dui bu qi. I hope I can helpher more or less, on the other hand, I am now learning English, and I think itwill also be a chance to practice and improve my English.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">It is just a beginning.</span></p>
