&uarr;I'm Yours&nbsp;&nbsp; by Jason Mraz

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it 

I tried to be chill but your so hot that I melted 

I fell right through the cracks, now I'm tryin to get back 

before the cool done run out I'll be givin it my best test 

and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention 

I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some 



But I won't hesitate no more, 

no more, it cannot wait 

I'm yours 



Well open up your mind and see like me 

open up your plans and damn you're free 

look into your heart and you'll find love love love love 

listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing

We're just one big family

And it's our godforsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved 



So, i won't hesitate no more, 

no more, it cannot wait i'm sure 

there's no need to complicate our time is short 

this is our fate

I'm yours 



Scooch on over closer, dear

And I will nibble your ear



I've been spendin' way too long checkin' my tongue in the mirror 

and bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer 

But my breath fogged up the glass 

and so I drew a new face and I laughed 

I guess what I'd be sayin' is there ain't no better reason 

to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons 

it's what we aim to do 

our name is our virtue 



But I won't hesitate no more, 

no more it cannot wait

I'm yours 



Well open up your mind and see like me 

open up your plans and damn you're free 

look into your heart and you will find that the sky is yours 



so please don't, please don't, please don't, 

there's no need to complicate, 

Cause our time is short 

This, this, this is our fate, 

I'm yours

Well, I seldom post articles to introduce songs in my blog. This time I am just fascinated by Jason Mraz, and recently I listen to this song every day and night.



Jason Mraz is a singer-songwriter, born and raised in Mechanicsville, Virginia. Mraz's stylistic influences include pop, rock, folk, jazz, and hip hop. He has played with various artists, including Dave Matthews Band, James Blunt(one of my favorite!!), Gavin DeGraw...and so on.



It's a song about admiring Nature. Every one belongs to Nature as this song named "I'm Yours." If you want to write a song for Nature, I think Jason Mraz's " I'm Yours" is the best greeting. This song has been #1 on AAA radio charts in the US for 3 weeks as of 06/15/2008 and was made famous by a live recording from his acoustic show at the Villa Montalvo Winery which received millions of hits on his Myspace.



Well,



Just enjoy it!!
