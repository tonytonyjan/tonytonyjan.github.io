Some tried to flee from the conflicts, while some evenarmed to fight. They have no command over themselves.</span><span lang="EN-US"><o:p><br /><br /></o:p>And on the other hand, as disaster, <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region> wasattacked by destructive typhoons these months, and it was indeed a tragedy thatit caused floods and deaths everywhere.

I just thinkit ironical. How can some people hooray and even cheer for the holiday causedby the disaster, while others hope the disaster can end as soon as possible? Isthere any one cheering for having the chance to go to school in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>? Ithink, after all, there can be some, but is not in high number. Maybe it is becausewe are too lucky and well-being, we easily forgetting we are lucky andwell-being.<br /><br /></span><span lang="EN-US"><o:p>Education is important, and in this aspect,generally to say, the education in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Taiwan</st1:country-region>may be better than that in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kenya</st1:place></st1:country-region>.However, there are students educated in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region> consider that they gloat over misfortune or disasters.</o:p></span><span lang="EN-US"><o:p><br /><br /></o:p>When a disaster comes, no matter it is atyphoon or conflict or even a war, which will we think first, holiday, orpeace?</span>
