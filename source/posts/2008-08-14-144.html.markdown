<h3 class="post-title entry-title">Still remember who Leo is? Yeah, he is the guy whom I met in Chiayi Train Station. The belowing is one of his articles in his blog about his Taiwan experience.</h3><p class="post-title entry-title">Quoted from <a href="http://gertens4.blogspot.com/2008/07/lost-luggage.html">http://gertens4.blogspot.com/2008/07/lost-luggage.html</a></p><p class="post-title entry-title"><hr /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class="post-title entry-title"><a href="http://gertens4.blogspot.com/2008/07/lost-luggage.html">Lost Luggage</a> </h3><div class="post-header-line-1"></div><div class="post-body entry-content"><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlo8ldtoVI/AAAAAAAAA-4/ZHFn-COYytw/s1600-h/DSCF0793.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/136_DSCF0793.JPG)</a>Sunrise over Alishan is a sight to be seen...or so we are told. None of us were too keen on the idea of a 3:30 am wake-up call to make it out to the sunrise viewing spot (although it seems as though everyone else in the hotel was). Maybe next time - some things just need to be skipped when traveling with a baby &amp; toddler!<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJloe5w_FzI/AAAAAAAAA-o/KUoQ3XzEfO0/s1600-h/DSCF0751.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/137_DSCF0751.JPG)</a><br />Since we had to take a bus up the mountain we were really hoping to take the Alpine Train back down. Leo managed to figure out that the train was not running all the way up to Alishan due to part of the track being washed out during the last typhoon - but we could get on at the next stop down the mountain. We had some time before we had to be on the bus - so we went a little hike through the mountains. It was BEAUTIFUL!<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlonzVQxTI/AAAAAAAAA-w/Jxo00YeL-vs/s1600-h/DSCF0756.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/138_DSCF0756.JPG)</a><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlr3jr5dcI/AAAAAAAAA_4/G6T2nUmor3g/s1600-h/DSCF0786.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/139_DSCF0786.JPG)</a><br />Sue even found a mountain elementary school - it looks a bit different than her school in Rosemount but still has a lot of similarities:<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlqMDXDZfI/AAAAAAAAA_Y/870cRUFXQ88/s1600-h/DSCF1108.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/140_DSCF1108.JPG)</a><br />Burning ghost money at one of the many mountain temples:<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlq2C1q2mI/AAAAAAAAA_g/GfrlQcd8i5s/s1600-h/DSCF0779.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/141_DSCF0779.JPG)</a><br />Our impromptu 7-11 picnic in Alishan:<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlpLDJNH7I/AAAAAAAAA_A/Ugm4LWxU0oU/s1600-h/DSCF0813.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/142_DSCF0813.JPG)</a><br />We managed to take the bus to Fenuyi and get tickets for the Alpine Train. The train was great - it was a a bit wobbly but allowed us for some great close-up views of the vegetation growing along the mountains.<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlrKabNEAI/AAAAAAAAA_o/zJsrKBajyZY/s1600-h/DSCF0825.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/143_DSCF0825.JPG)</a><br />However, when switching from the bus to the train one needs to make sure that they remember to take all of their luggage! We realized after the bus had already left that we forgot our suitcase! Yikes! But we still tried to enjoy the train &amp; figured that both the train &amp; bus would end up at the same spot (the city of Chiayi) so hopefully it would be waiting for us.<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlrbk68zDI/AAAAAAAAA_w/qjLQH45J0pk/s1600-h/DSCF0842.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/144_DSCF0842.JPG)</a>And luckily a nice Taiwanese Tony took pity on us &amp; helped negotiate a trip to the main bus station to pick up our suitcase! He even missed his bus in order to help us and would not take cab money or at least bus fare for helping! Leo is getting quite adept at speaking Chinese - but sometimes you just need a little local help! And luckily Taiwan has lots of locals willing to help out a 'waiguoren' (foreigner).<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlpjH8Sy-I/AAAAAAAAA_I/I3OBJh1zDu4/s1600-h/DSCF0852.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/145_DSCF0852.JPG)</a>One more train ride &amp; we made it to Kaohsiung. A little tired &amp; a little hungry - but still having fun. Especially Conrad who got a YELLOW backpack at the Kaohsiung train station that had Red Elmo &amp; Blue Elmo on it :)<br /><br /><a onblur="function anonymous(){function anonymous(){try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}}}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_G9_VVVSQbf0/SJlpvwOOC_I/AAAAAAAAA_Q/EB6T0gJN3Qw/s1600-h/DSCF0857.JPG">![](/images/slum-area/146_DSCF0857.JPG)</a> </div>
